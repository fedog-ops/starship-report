# Starship Crew Development Log ðŸš€


## Overview
The Starship Crew Development Log is a tool designed to help starship officers track the performance, behavior, and development of crew members during long-term space missions. Officers can log and review crew observations to ensure peak performance and well-being throughout deep space exploration.

This system allows officers to maintain and review detailed crew reports, while the shipâ€™s captain has full oversight of crew development. Access to these records is tightly controlled to maintain the security of mission-critical data.

## Features
1. Officer Role

Enter Crew Reports: Officers can log text-based reports about crew members. These logs are time-stamped for historical accuracy.

Multiple Entries: Officers can make multiple observations about a crew member over time, recording development or concerns during the mission.

Editable within One Month: Officers have a one-month window to view and edit their own reports. After this time, logs are locked for editing to preserve the integrity of the records.

2. Captain Role

Full Observation Overview: The Captain can view a time-ordered history of all observations made about a crew member.

Generate Full Reports: The Captain can generate a complete report of all crew members' development logs, which can be downloaded as mission-critical data.

Manage Users: The Captain can assign officers (who log observations) and maintain the crew roster. Non-assigned personnel cannot access the system or its data.

Revoke Officer Access: The Captain can revoke access to an officer at any time, ensuring control over who can log or view crew performance reports.
